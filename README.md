# OurTube

OurTube is a software built in Flutter made with educational purposes that allows the download of media content using https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl. Due to the use of ytdl, the application will be built for Windows (Linux is excluded right now due to a possible transition of the software).

The application downloads and updated ytdl and ffmpeg for video-to-audio conversion and afterwards, an input allows to paste a URL that will be verified. If the format is correct and a valid video is found, the download may be done.

The application will download the content in the 'Downloads' directory of the OS by default or in the specific directory set by the user.
