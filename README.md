# OurTube

OurTube is a software built in Flutter made with educational purposes that allows the download of media content using https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl. Due to the use of ytdl, the application will be built only in Windows and Linux.

The application downloads and updated ytdl and other dependencies for video-to-audio conversion and afterwards, an input allows to paste a URL that will be verified. If the format is correct and a valid video is found, the download may be done.

Currently, the application will download the content in the 'Downloads' directory of the OS.
